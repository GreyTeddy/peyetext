- Install requirements in an enrivornemnt with `Python3.8`.
- Run `main.py`.
- Copy an image to clipboard.

- Text should paste (by emulating `CTRL + V`) to field.


It works but it's not the most accurate.

[TODO]
  - Implement check for operating system
    - Different key combination for macOS: `Command-V`
